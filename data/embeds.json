    "description": "In-Game Rules for Florida State Roleplay These rules are in place to ensure a fun, fair, and realistic roleplaying environment for everyone. Please read them carefully and adhere to them at all times. Failure to follow these rules may result in warnings, kicks, or bans. [R1] Random Deathmatch (RDM) You are not allowed to kill, attack, or injure another player without a valid in-character reason and proper initiation. This means no unprovoked shootings, stabbings, or physical assaults. There must be a clear roleplay scenario leading up to any hostile action. [R2] Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM) You are not allowed to use your vehicle as a weapon to intentionally hit, ram, or kill other players or their vehicles. Accidental collisions happen, but intentional VDM will be punished severely.

This will result in an ban [R6] Cuff Rushing Always when you arresting someone you must say -cuffs- or \"cuffs\". [R7] Auto Arresting Always when you arrested someone you must transport him to jail. [R8] Cop Baiting You are not allowed to intentionally provoke or harass law enforcement officers (LEO) solely to get their attention, initiate a chase, or cause a reaction. This includes driving recklessly in front of them, constantly honking, or verbally abusing them without a valid roleplay reason. [R9] Tow Rushing You are not allowed to tow vehicles without a valid reason or without being legitimately called to do so as part of a roleplay scenario (e.g., a broken-down car, an illegally parked vehicle where authorized to tow). [R10] Safe Zones Certain areas are designated as Safe Zones where no hostile actions (killing, robbing, arresting, etc.) are permitted. These include:  Police Stations (interior and immediate exterior) Sheriff's Stations (interior and immediate exterior) Fire Department (interior and immediate exterior) DOT Station (interior and immediate exterior) Civilian Spawn Point (main city spawn) Violating this rule can result in severe punishment. [R11] Department Liveries and Uniforms When actively working for any official department (Police, Fire, Sheriff, DOT), you must wear the correct, official department uniform and use the appropriate department livery on your vehicle. Using incorrect uniforms or liveries, or impersonating a department you are not part of, is not allowed. [R12] Hostage You are not allowed to kidnap or take staff members hostage. Staff members are present to moderate and assist, and their ability to do so should not be hindered by roleplay. [R13] Banned Roleplay Scenarios To ensure a safe and respectful environment, certain roleplay scenarios are strictly prohibited.",
